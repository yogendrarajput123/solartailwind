              Assess Your Energy Usage:
            </p>
            <p>
              Start by understanding how much energy you currently consume.
              Review your electricity bills to determine your usage and identify
              peak periods. This analysis will help you determine the size of
              the solar energy system you need.

            </p>
            <p>
              Educate yourself about solar energy and its different aspects.
              Explore various solar technologies, incentives, and financing
              options. Consult reliable solar companies for expert guidance and
              obtain multiple quotes to compare.

              Site Evaluation:
            </p>
            <p>
              Arrange a site assessment with a solar professional. They will
              assess your property's orientation, shading, and structural
              integrity to determine the best placement for solar panels. This
              assessment ensures maximum energy generation and system
              efficiency.
